# Script to inspect the shell you are running, to make sure you are running the expected shell. Commonly used in script you source
#
# :Arguments: ``$1...`` - Valid names of shells
# :Return Value: * ``0`` - Check passed
#                * ``1`` - Check failed
# :Uses: * ``/proc`` or ``ps``. ``ps`` must support the ``-p`` and ``-o`` flags.
