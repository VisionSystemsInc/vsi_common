Poratble Patch
==============

.. default-domain:: bash

.. file:: portable_patch

Patches an executable (or library) to be portable enough to run on another Linux (with equal or newer glic). This is accomplished by copying the executable and all dependent dynamic libraries to a destination directory, renaming all libraries using their hash, and patching the relevant linking information.

:Arguments: * ``$1`` - The executable to be patched
            * ``$2`` - The directory to copy the executable and dynamic dependencies
            * [``$3``] - The rpath. Defaults to the absolute path of ``$2``

.. note::
  Requires ``patchelf`` to be installed

.. var:: glibc_common_libraries
