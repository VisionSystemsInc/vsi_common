===================================
Singularity Compatibility Variables
===================================

.. default-domain:: bash

.. file:: compat_singularity.bsh

A collection of variables to help cope with the differences between singularity versions.

.. function:: singularity_singularityenv_priority_bug

In singularity 3.0-3.5, there is an ambiguity when it comes to the precedence of ``{VAR}`` vs ``SINGULARITYENV_{VAR}`` variables being inherited from the host.

:Return Value: * ``0`` - Singularity has the ambiguity bug, and the value of the environment variable will be hard to predict
               * ``1`` - Singularity does not have the ambiguity bug, and ``SINGULARITYENV_`` takes priority.
