.. default-domain:: bash

.. file:: file_tools.bsh

Tools that deal with opening file descriptors and the like.

.. function:: find_open_fd

:Arguments: * [``name``] - Variable name to return available file descriptor. Default: ``fd``
            * {``START_FD``} - The first fd to start checking. Default: ``10``
:Output: {``name``} - Value of next unused file descriptor

Find the first open file descriptor

.. rubric:: Usage

This is for backwards compatibility. In ``bash`` 4.1 or newer, this isn't necessary, as:

.. code-block:: bash

    exec {fd}<>${some_buffer}
    echo "hi" >&${fd}
    read -u${fd} some_var
    exec {fd}>&-

is better and ~100x faster.

.. rubric:: Example

.. code-block:: bash

  mkfifo /tmp/test
  find_open_fd
  eval "exec ${fd}<>"/tmp/test"
  echo hi >&${fd}
  read -u ${fd} -t 1 line
  eval "exec ${fd}>&-"

.. rubric:: Bugs

Probably not thread safe

.. seealso::
  :func:`open_fd`, :func:`close_fd`

.. function:: open_fd

:Arguments: * All options are optional
            * ``-p`` - Pipe mode (use mkfifo)
            * ``-f`` - File mode (use touch)
            * ``-n`` {name} - Name of buffer used
            * ``-s`` - Use the same fd for read and write
            * ``-r`` {#} - Use this specific fd for reading
            * ``-w`` {#} - Use this specific fd for writing
            * ``-R`` {name} - Name of variable to store read fd in. Default: ``fd_r``
            * ``-W`` {name} - Name of variable to store write fd in. Default: ``fd_w``
            *  Variables names starting with _ should be avoided as they may clash with variables used in this function
:Output: * Read and write variables will contain the corresponding file descriptors
         * filename - Name of file/pipe that was opened.

Find available file descriptor and open a file/pipe for you

.. rubric:: Example

.. code-block:: bash

  # Make a pipe
  pipe="$(mktemp -u)"

  # Open the pipe
  open_fd -p -s -n -W fd "${pipe}"

  # Write to the pipe - does not block as long as buffer not filled
  echo "hi" >&${fd}

  # Blocking read from pipe. Use timeout command to add a timeout
  timeout 1 cat - <&${fd}

  # Read from the pipe and save to a variable without a subshell
  IFS='' read -u "${fd}" -t 0.1 -r my_variable

  # Close and cleanup
  close_fd "${fd}"
  rm "${pipe}"

  Do NOT
    output=$(open_fd)
  Because open_fd will be executed in a subshell, and thus the opened fd will
  be useless. This is the design decision behind storing the file descriptor
  in the fd variable.

.. note::
  Opening a pipe without the same fd for read and write doesn't work very
  well. It hangs on most tested systems. Workarounds are unpredictable at
  best. So just don't do that.

  :func:`close_fd` :func:`time_tools.bsh timeout`

.. function:: close_fd

:Arguments: * ``1`` - fd number
            * [``2``] - fd number

Closes open ``bash`` fds

.. rubric:: Usage

Uses eval for you, so you don't have to feel uncomfortable eval'ing
