Ask Question
============

.. default-domain:: bash

.. file:: ask_question

Bash CLI version of :func:`ask_question`

:Arguments: ``$1`` - The question

            [``$2``] - Default answer (when user presses enter only)

:Output: Returns ``0`` for yes, ``1`` for no

.. seealso::
  :func:`ask_question`

.. function:: ask_question

Pretty version of ask Y/N question with optional default value

:Arguments: ``$1`` - The question

            ``$2`` - Variable to store answer in. 1 for yes, 0 for no

            [``$3``] - Default answer (when user presses enter only)

            [``!2``] - If the value of the variables named by $2 is set, then this will override the answer for the question asked. This is a good way to automate calling a script/function that contains ask_question andskip prompting the user for an answer.

:Output: Stores ``1`` for yes, and ``0`` for no in the variable specified by ``$2``

.. rubric:: Example

.. code-block:: bash

   ask_question "Continue?" y

   ask_question "Would you like to play a game?" play y

   ans=y

   ask_question "This question will not wait, but answer yes for you." ans n

.. note::
  Only the first letter of the response matters. Accepted values are yYnN
  (and blank if a default answer is given), else the question is asked again
  until an appropriate response is given.

.. warning::
   If the same variable is used for multiple :func:`ask_question` calls, then the result from the first call will act as the override. Luckily it is a ``1`` or ``0``, so it won't give a valid answer. But the best practice is to use different variable names for consecutive ask_question's
