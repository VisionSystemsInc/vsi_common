Singularity Functions
=====================

.. default-domain:: bash

.. file:: singularity_functions.bsh

Set of functions to make using singularity easier

.. envvar:: SINGULARITY

Name/path of singularity executable

Instead of hard-coding "singularity" everywhere, use the variable :envvar:`SINGULARITY` so that when the need comes, it is easier to switch which executable gets called.

.. function:: Singularity

:Arguments: ``$1``.. - Arguments to be sent to singularity command
:Parameters: * [``DRYRUN``] - Optional variable inserted at the beginning of all singularity commands. Useful for setting to "echo" or similar for dryrun mode
             * ``SINGULARITY_EXTRA_ARGS`` - Array of extra arguments inserted after singularity but before the singularity subcommand
             * ``SINGULARITY_EXTRA_{subcommand}_ARGS`` - Extra arguments inserted right after the singularity subcommand
:Output: Runs singularity command

Helper function to execute the right singularity command, or just dryrun

Instead of calling the singularity command directly, this Singularity function should
be called instead (for all dryrun-able activities. Simple commands like
inspect, ps, etc. don't make as much sense to dryrun, as the reset of the
script will never be executed, thus rendering dryrun useless.)

.. function:: singularity_env_pass

Function that defines the action needed to pass an environment variable to singularity. For singularity, exported environment variables that are prefixed with ``SINGULARITYENV_`` are passed to the singularity container, with the prefix stripped. This is more connivent than the first method of creating a temporary file, and mounting it into the singularity metadata ``env`` directory.

:Arguments: ``$1`` - Name of environment variable (without prefix)
            ``$2`` - The desired value of the environment variable

.. seealso::

   See :func:`container_functions.bsh container_environment_override`
       You can pass ``"singularity_env_pass"`` to :func:`container_functions.bsh container_environment_override` as an argument

.. envvar:: ${JUST_PROJECT_PREFIX}_SINGULAR_COMPOSE_FILES

An array storing the singular-compose files to be loaded by :func:`singular_load_env`, populated by :cmd:`just_singularity_functions.bsh singular_defaultify singular-compose`

.. function:: singular_load_env

Loads the singular-compose variables into memory

:Arguments: ``$1`` - Instance name
:Parameters: * [``${JUST_PROJECT_PREFIX}_SINGULAR_COMPOSE_FILES``] - Array storing the singular-compose files to be loaded. If empty, then see ``JUST_SINGULAR_COMPOSE_DIR``.
             * [``JUST_SINGULAR_COMPOSE_DIR``] - By default, if ``${JUST_PROJECT_PREFIX}_SINGULAR_COMPOSE_FILES`` is unset, the singular-compose files will initially be searched for in the ``JUSTFILE`` directory, and then up the parent dirs until / is hit. However, if you wish to the disable this behavior and start searching for a singular-compose file from the current directory where "just" is called, then set this var to an empty string. You can also set to a specific directory to start searching from within that directory.
:Outputs: * ``singular_volumes`` - The list of volumes to be bind mounted to the container
          * ``singular_flags`` - Extra flags that need to be passed to singularity to execute the container right
          * ``singular_environment`` - A key-value pair array of environment variables that need to be passed to the singularity container.
          * ``singular_image`` - The filename of the singularity image used.
          * ``singular_mount_points`` - List of mount points that need to be created when importing a docker image to singularity. This is only important for older systems that do not support overlayfs (like CentOS 6). Directories must end in ``/``, and files must not.
