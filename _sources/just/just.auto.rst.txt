.. file:: just

When working on a project, it often becomes necessary to run many long commands. Similar to how a makefile connects `targets` with a string of commands, `just` gives an easy way to create a set of targets to execute easily. Unlike a makefile, it has two key distinctions

* It's not a makefile, but uses a :file:`Justfile` in bash instead. Bash is easier than make for simple tasks
* It works on Windows (when bash is installed via Git for Windows or similar), macOS (which uses bash 3.2) and Linux with no additional dependencies.

.. rubric:: Features

* Tab completion (:file:`.just`)
* Comment generated help
* Subcommands (e.g. ``just program run``, run can be a subcommand of the program target)
* Executing multiple targets in one call

    Tab completion for bash

.. command:: help

Print out basic help based on the comments it the :file:`Justfile`. In order to achieve this, case statements and comments need to be structured in a specific way for the parser to pick up. The same mechanism is used by tab completion in ``bash``

.. note::

    Currently this does not work for all ``bash`` cases. A few bash patterns are matched to make this behavior working, since bash does not have source reflection.

.. rubric:: Basic example:

In the simplest case, a regular case pattern followed by ``)#`` (with optional spaces) will be picked up by :cmd:`help`

.. code-block:: bash

    foo) # Runs the foo routine

.. rubric:: Long comment lines

A long comment can be split up into many lines by ending a line with ``\`` (that means no space after ``\``), and the comment on the next line continue.

.. code-block:: bash

    command) # To write a long help message, end the line in a backslash (\) \
             # and start the next line with a # to continue the comment. \
             # Can be as long as you want.

.. rubric:: Multiple targets at once:

The pattern ``pattern1|pattern2...)#`` will also be parsed as a single help entry

.. code-block:: bash

    cat|dog) # Routine for cats and dogs

.. rubric:: Multiple targets:

You can actually add any of the other patterns as a comment for the sole purpose of populating the help and tab completion

.. code-block:: bash

    # cat) # Comment just for cat
    # dog) # Comment just for dog
    cat|\
    dog) # A comment here would be for both cat and dog, but not needed

.. rubric:: Subcommand example:

.. code-block:: bash

    foo_cat) # Runs the foo routine for cat
    foo_dog) # Runs the foo routine for dog

.. rubric:: Commenting extra help subcommand:

.. code-block:: bash

    # foo_a) # Runs the foo routine for a
    # foo_b) # Runs the foo routine for b
    foo_*)
    ## foo_c) # Runs the foo routine for c, but don't tell anyone

The foo_a and foo_b are added to tab complete and help, but using more than one `#` will disable that line all together. So foo_c is ignored and does not show up in help or tab complete.

.. rubric:: Advanced Expansion subcommand array:

When you have a list of subcommands for a command in an array, then that can use that array to generate help/tab completion entries

.. code-block:: bash

    # Example array
    MY_ARRAY=(cat dog)

    ...

    # catch_{MY_ARRAY}) #Catch animal
    catch_*)

Help, tab complete, etc. will automatically be expanded to cat and dog. Very useful for *DRY* and for programmatically determined subtargets. The subtarget name is appended to the end of the comment. So this example will read

::

    catch
        cat - Catch animal cat
        dog - Catch animal dog

.. note::

    Help and tab completion use the exact same mechanism. Everything that adds an entry to the help is adding an entry to tab completion.

.. envvar:: JUST_PRELOAD

Preloads a special source file before anything else loads.

In rare case that the project environment file is too late in the just loading, use this file. It is suggested to set the value in the :envvar:`JUST_SETUP_SCRIPT`, which defaults to setup.env.

.. note::

    This is left around for debug purposes really, probably never needed.

.. note::

  Must **not** be set in the :ref:`project environment files <just-project-env-files>` i.e. cannot be set in ``local.env``, project env file or ``local_post.env``. It will **not** have the desired effect, as this is too late in the load chain. Instead, it can either be exported before calling :file:`just` (not recommended unless in a container or VM) or exported in the :ref:`setup file <just-setup-file>`.

.. envvar:: JUST_VERBOSE

:Values: * **1** - Prints any dryrun-able commands as they are executed
         * **2** - Basic bash verbose. Uses ``set -v``
         * **3** - Fully verbose. ``set -xv`` plus a useful ``PS4``

:envvar:`JUST_VERBOSE` sets verbosity level of just execution. Useful to debug problems, especially in the just executable.

.. note::

  Must **not** be set in the :ref:`project environment files <just-project-env-files>` i.e. cannot be set in ``local.env``, project env file or ``local_post.env``. It will **not** have the desired effect, as this is too late in the load chain. Instead, it can either be exported before calling :file:`just` (not recommended unless in a container or VM) or exported in the :ref:`setup file <just-setup-file>`.

..envvar:: JUST_IGNORE_EXIT_CODES

A regular expression that represents exit codes that will result in a just stack trace not being printed out. This is good for handling errors that are expected to happen, and do not need a misleading stack track when you know the problem is a known issue, like a missing file, etc... Default: ``0``, (disabled).

.. rubric:: Examples:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Justfile example
    just_target)
      local JUST_IGNORE_EXIT_CODES=2
      bash -c "exit 2"
      ;;

    # More example values
    25      # Only 25 is ignore
    24$|^25 # 24 or 25 is ignored ^ is implied at the beginning, and $ at the end
    2.      # 20-29
    .*      # All exit codes
    3.$|^72 # 30-39 or 72
    $|5|^   # Any code with a 5 in it, 5, 15, 25... 50-59, etc

.. envvar:: JUST_IN_SCRIPT

:envvar:`JUST_IN_SCRIPT` is an unexported variable set by :file:`just`. Useful in other scripts for determining if they are being sourced by :file:`just` or not.

Currently one use of this is dual purposing a file, so that it behaves differently when sourced by just or by a user on the prompts

.. envvar:: JUSTFILE

An optional variable for the location of :file:`Justfile`. The default :file:`Justfile` that :func:`just_common.bsh _just_load_justfile` searches for is called ``Justfile``. In order to change this default behavior, this environment variable needs to be set so that :file:`just` knows what file name to look for, usually not recommended

.. seealso::

  :func:`just_common.bsh _just_load_justfile`
    Function responsible for loading :file:`Justfile`

  :func:`dir_tools.bsh parent_find_files`
    Function responsible for finding :file:`Justfile`

  :envvar:`JUSTFILE`
    Changes the name of the default :file:`Justfile` to a different filename when creating a new project

.. note::

   Must **not** be set in the :ref:`project environment files <just-project-env-files>` i.e. cannot be set in ``local.env``, project env file or ``local_post.env``. It will **not** have the desired effect, as this is too late in the load chain. Instead, it can either be exported before calling :file:`just` (not recommended unless in a container or VM) or exported in the :ref:`setup file <just-setup-file>`.

Error handling
--------------

An error in a :file:`Justfile` can be extremely hard to debug. Especially when the bug manifests itself deep inside :file:`just`. For this reason, it is customary to turn ``set -eu`` on, so that if a bash command returns false, the script stops. (``-u`` says that if a variable is used without being defined, to throw and error too).

The ``ERR`` signal is also trapped by :file:`just`. When any error occurs, a complete bash stack trace is printed to stdout upon exit.

::

    Call stack

    993  _Docker-compose  /opt/projects/just/vsi_common/linux/docker_functions.bsh

Sometimes there are multiple stacks due to the way `bash` works. However the first one is usually the stack of interest. This stack printout says an error occurred in ``_Docker-compose`` line 993, and can be tracked down to ``Justfile`` line 120. In this case, a ``docker-compose`` command returned non-zero
