This script allow us to install only one of the four available opencv-python packages via pip-tools.

:Arguments: * ``$1``... - The path to the ``requirements.txt`` to be inline patched

OpenCV provides four interchangable python packages:
- opencv-contrib-python: main modules, contrib/extra, GUI
- opencv-python: main modules, GUI
- opencv-contrib-python-headless: main modules, contrib/extra, headless (no GUI)
- opencv-python-headless: main modules, headless (no GUI)

Users are advised to install only one of the four packages opencv-python depending on their needs
https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/#:~:text=There%20are%20four,only%20one%20package

This function will modify a pip-tools ``requirements.txt`` file to keep only the most fully featured opencv-python package.  Less featured opencv-python packages are commented out from the ``requirements.txt`` file.

A subsequent ``pip-sync`` must be run with the argument ``--pip-args --no-deps`` to ensure only one opencv-python package is installed.
