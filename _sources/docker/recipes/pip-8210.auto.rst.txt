This script allows us to install a package outside of pip-tools. In order to accomplish this correctly, we use the ``requirements.txt`` file as a constraint file to handle corner cases like pip issue 8210.

To accomplish this, it adds the ``-c`` constraints to ``pip install``, ``pip download``, and ``pip wheel`` sub-commands.

You should activate your virtualenv before calling this; it will use the ``pip`` on the path.

:Arguments: * [--if-not-found <executable name>] - Only runs the ``pip`` command if a specified executable is not found.
            * ``$1``... - Args to pass to ``pip``. E.g. ``install pip-tools``

.. note::

   If the first package is ``pip-tools``, it will install pip-tools even if it is not in ``requirements.txt`` (necessary to bootstrap new ``requirements.txt`` files). If additional arguments were added in this corner case, the return value will be non-zero since not all the packages got installed, but ``pip-tools`` did get installed.
